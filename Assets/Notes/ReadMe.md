Goal:
	1. on ball movement, the 4 corner tiles should highlight to show the direction tile light up
	2. on ball movement, the floor should highlight the quadrent on which the ball is currently on

folder "WithoutObserver - Singleton approach" was first created to show how a singleton pattern may be used to detect the quadrent of the ball, or which direction ball moves towards.

folder "With Observer Pattern" intends to achieve the same output and verify the need for using this system


see "TransformConverter.cs" to understand how to get a local Transform Position for another gameobjec that is not inside your gameobject
